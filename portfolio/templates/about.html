<h1 class="display-3 text-center">About Me</h1>
<div class="text-center">
    <div class="container-fluid myBox">
        <p>Welcome to my about me page! I’d like to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about myself and how I ended up on the path that I’m on currently. I won’t bore you with my entire life story leading up to this point but mostly where my interest in programming and building websites came from.</p>
        <p>I was born in San Antonio Texas where I’ve spent most of my life. I moved to Phoenix Arizona when I was 13 where I finished high school and spent what I like to think were my golden years! I enjoy humor, sports, and a good sci-fi story.</p>
        <p>Most passionately though, I love video games! So much so that learning how to develop video games was a driving force for me in High school for a long time. I’ve been playing video games in some form since I was 3 years old and knew it would be part of me till the end of my days. My interest in game design led me to explore the many different aspects of creating video games. However, I am by no means a very artistic person so I knew I’d likely end up in developing mechanics, engines, and more programmatic aspects of video games. But, life hits all of us in different ways and fresh out of high school, going directly in college wasn’t in my best interest. Among other things, I’d be lying if I said I was the most determined student in my class.</p>
        <p>Right out of high school I ended up working at Wells Fargo as a temp and shortly thereafter at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas as a production line worker. The work was tough and the hours were extremely long. I learned a lot in the 7 years I spent at Toyota and don’t regret any of it. It also paid the bills quite nicely in the meantime! Still, I couldn’t help but feel I had forgotten what my true passions were and lost sight of my goals along the way. I ended up promoted to a position on the assembly line as a team leader where I had the opportunity to work directly with industrial robots. This experience coupled with the motivation of some of my closest friends reignited my passions for technology and computers that I had lost in past years.</p>
        <p>After a long thought process in what I wanted out of life it was decided to take a huge risk and devote a large portion of my savings into curving my career path into something more interesting to me. Enter Python programming. </p>
        <p>I had no idea what I was getting myself into when taking my first steps into learning about coding. There were so many languages and so many things to read. The possibilities were practically endless. I could barely decide on whether I wanted to invest in college or not. In the end, I took up the daunting challenge of teaching myself how to code. I had always been a strong learner and knew if I set my mind to it I could find my own way to my goal. Even most of my computer knowledge prior to this adventure was all picked up passively through experience. If I could learn how to assemble, maintain, and service computers on my own. Why not learn how to make them sing as well?</p>
        <p>So that’s the gist of it. Like a lot of people I woke up to the idea I was doing something I wasn’t really interested in and was practically working for a paycheck. The journey to learn basic programming has been difficult and it’s still not over. I know there is so much left for me to learn but I’m proud of how far I’ve come without a school structure and am glad to share my work with you on this site.</p>
        <p>Below are some of the certificates for some of the online courses that I followed to help teach me what I know so far. Please check out my projects page for some of my work and of course feel free to contact me with questions!</p>
